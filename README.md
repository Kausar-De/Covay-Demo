# COVAY WEBSITE CODEBASE DEMO

This is a website in production which lists all the available oxygen centers and COVID meals available with the recently verified ones at top. We also provide the location and phone numbers of the same. It was made in very short notice to push out verified information we have to the people who are in need of it right now. We have many features in the pipeline preparing for release, along with plans for nation-wide expansion!


A big thank you to the 200+ verifiers that are working with us day and night to ensure availability and integrity of all listings.


The website currently features oxygen and covid meal listings, a homepage and a contributors page, pagination, and live updates to the listings.


The backend is made using Python's Django framework. The front-end utilizes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Bootstrap4. The database is PostgreSQL and Google Maps API has been used for generating maps for each listing. CSS Media tags have been used to make website fully mobile-friendly. 


Please note that this is simply a demo repository to exhibit the codebase of the live deployment. Settings and env files, PKI and API as well as database credentials have been obscured to ensure the security of the live deployment. This repo will be updated continuously in sync with the live build to show the changes made to the code, however, any changes or data that might compromise the main website will not be committed here.


Naturally, this particular repository has no live deployment anywhere and is currently NOT accepting external collaborators. If you would like to see the real website in action, please visit it at [covay.in](https://covay.in).
